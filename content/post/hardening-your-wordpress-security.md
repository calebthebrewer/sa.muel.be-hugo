## Introduction

This is the second part of a guide about [recovering a hacked WordPress](/2015/recovering-a-hacked-wordpress/) and hardening your WordPress security.

In the previous part, I showed you how to get back up and running after your website has been hacked. In this part I'll demonstrate how you can avoid being hacked by making your WordPress more secure. I always try to be exhaustive, but if you have any suggestions, corrections or feel like anything is missing, I would like you to [let me know](mailto:s@muel.be?subject=Suggestions%20for%20the%20post%20about%20securing%20Wordpress).

Even if you're not hacked, I still advice you to read the first part too. It contains some information about how attackers work, what they try to achieve and how you can make sure they lose access to your website.

While this guide focusses on security, some measures could impact the performance of your website negatively while others should impact your performance positively. It's up to you to consider which measures tips you should implement and which you shouldn't.

Now, let's get started, shall we?

## Consider to use a cloud proxy

### Keeping hackers out

### Encryption

## Make sure the web servers are secure

## Use strong authentication and authorisation

## Consider using a 3rd party email provider

## Always use the latest versions

## Uninstall plugins and themes you don't need

## Schedule security scans

## Log bad behaviour

## Change the defaults
