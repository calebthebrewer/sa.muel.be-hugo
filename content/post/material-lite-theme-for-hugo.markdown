title = "Material-lite theme for hugo"

+++

Last week, [I wrote a post](/2015/an-introduction-to-hugo-a-static-site-generator/) about how awesome [hugo](http://gohugo.io) is and why I switched from Jekyll to hugo.

Then, a few days later, Google released an awesome template called [Material Design Lite](http://getmdl.io). It's basically Google's famous [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript intead of in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org).

I was thinking about setting up another website for some side project and wanted to use material design. So I decided to write a material design theme for a simple hugo blog.
