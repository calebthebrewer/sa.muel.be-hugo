While I was working on a website made with Laravel and Ardent I had to validate a password confirmation field for a user registration. This will not work if you follow the standard documentation.

This is how your [validation rules](http://laravel.com/docs/validation) in your [Ardent](https://github.com/laravelbook/ardent) model should look like (users only have an email address and a password):

    public static $rules = array(
      'email' => 'required|email|max:100|unique:users',
      'password' => 'required|min:6|confirmed',
    );

Your model should also have the following line somewhere:

    public $autoPurgeRedundantAttributes = true;

Now, if you follow the documentation and include every database field in the _fillable_ array, validation will always fail on the password confirmation.

The workaround is to include the password confirmation field in the fillable array, even if it isn't a column in your database.

    protected $fillable = array('email', 'password', 'activation_code', 'confirmed', 'reset_password', 'password_confirmation');
