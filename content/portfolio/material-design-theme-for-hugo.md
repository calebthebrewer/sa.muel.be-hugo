As I wanted to learn more about [hugo](http://gohugo.io) while developing [this blog](/portfolio/this-blog/), I [created](/2015/material-lite-theme-for-hugo/) a new theme for hugo. It is mostly plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but it also contains some [Go Templating](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/).

The theme is based on the [blog template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/index.html) from Google's [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/hugo-material-lite) and I host [a demo](http://materialexample.sa.muel.be/) on GitHub Pages.
