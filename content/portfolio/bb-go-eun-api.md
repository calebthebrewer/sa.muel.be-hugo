+++

This API was made for the [Android app B&B Go Eun](/portfolio/bb-go-eun/).

It is written in PHP and built on top of [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/). The API returns all results in JSON and is follows most the RESTful API design principles. It relies on a MySQL database for all of its data.

Since the assignment was graded in June 2014, it's possible that the API is no longer available. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/MI4API).
