In 2015 the General Student Council (ASR) Odisee elected me to be their IT manager. I become responsible for several services, one of which was their website.

The website is built with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and stored on a shared hosting account. I customized the theme and setup [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). As the website was hacked in the months before I became the administrator, I had to [restore](/2015/recovering-a-hacked-wordpress/) and [secure](/2015/hardening-your-wordpress-security/) it.

I managed this website from June 2015 until July 2016.
