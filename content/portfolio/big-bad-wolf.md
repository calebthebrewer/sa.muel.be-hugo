This is simple social media client written in C#. It was a school project we made in a team of 4 students. This was our first project in C# and the goal was to learn about

* Multi Document Interfaces (MDI) with Windows Forms
* using [Visual Studio Online](http://visualstudio.com) (Team Foundation Services) to work with scrum, sprints... The burndown chart was more important than the code or the finished application.
* usage of APIs / working with SDKs
* (an introduction to) async code

With this social media client, you could connect your Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts and view all the posts in your timeline/activity feed in a single window. Every post had a background color matching the *theme* of the social network it was published on.

I agree, the GUI was terrible and the code wasn't much better. But we had to start *somewhere*, right? I've made the source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/BigBadWolf).
