RoboRally is a simple game written in Java, based on the board game [RoboRally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally) by [Wizards of the Coast](http://company.wizards.com/).

This game was a semester project in which a pair of students had to learn the basics of object oriented programming, source code control and extreme programming. The project was part of the course [Object Oriented Programming](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H01P1AN.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp2111760) by [Prof. E. Steegmans](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/eric).

The code contains a lot of documentation; this project is really about the code and not about the game itself. Our final version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/OGProborally).
