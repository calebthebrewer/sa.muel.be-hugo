Go For Change is an Android app I wrote in 2 weeks for a school project. It was actually part of another student's internship, but since that student quit his internship, the client asked my lecturers if they knew another student who could finish the job. All I had was 2 weeks so I didn't write any documentation and the code is quite messy.

The application contains a questionnaire targeted to small business owners. The difficult part was the order of the questions. Some questions only had to be answered depending on the answers of previous questions and the client had to be able to change the questions, the possible answers and the order of the questions. I created a small SQLite database and a method to export the answered questions to a CSV file.

This application is only visible for test users.
