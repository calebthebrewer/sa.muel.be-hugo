In January 2014 I had to develop a webshop in PHP for a school project. At the time we just learnt about MVC and the best framework for the job seemed [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org). My webshop had responsive design and was very fast (high scores on PageSpeed and Yahoo YSlow).

The webshop itself is no longer available online, but the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/MI4webshop).

## Functional requirements

### Configuration panel

* CRUD actions for every kind of data
