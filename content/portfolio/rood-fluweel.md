Rood Fluweel Bali is a Windows Store app, designed for Windows 8.1 desktops and tablets. I made this app for [Comm-IT](http://www.comm-it.be) as part of a summer job.

[Rood Fluweel](http://www.roodfluweel.be) is a SaaS made on top of ASP.NET. It can manage ticketing, reservations, payments etc.

The goal of the Windows Store app is to make it easier to print and create tickets when a lot of people are coming through the entrance at once.
