This Android app was a school project I made with [another student](https://github.com/talipovdaniyar). We established several goals:

## Technical requirements:

* We had to learn a lot about PHP and Android development.
* The app had to connect with [a (RESTful) API](/portfolio/bb-go-eun-api/).
* The API had to connect with a database.
* The app had to be very simple so we could demonstrate the main goals (connection with API).
* We had to made sure that everything worked fine and all known bugs were fixed.
* We had to write a few pages of documentation for our lecturer.

## Functional requirements:

* Show information about available rooms
* Show contact information with links that open the diailer app, the email app, Google Maps...
* Show promotions coupled to rooms
* Show the breakfast menu
* Show nearby points of interest in a predefined range, sorted by distance

The assignment included finding a real client and the client we chose was a friend who owns a B&B on AirBnB.

Since the assignment was graded in June 2014, it's possible that the app is no longer available. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/MI4App).
