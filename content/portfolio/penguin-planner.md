Penguin Planner is a school project we made in team of 4 students. The goal of the project was to learn about:

* layered applications (seperating data, business/domain, presentation...)
* connecting an application to a database without using plain (T-)SQL
* multilingual applications

The idea of Penguin Planner was a replacement for a tool like [BlackBoard](http://blackboard.com). It was a tool made for students and teachers. They had to be able to manage their courses, tasks, tests...

We used [MetroFramework](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui) to bring the *Modern UI* design to a Windows Forms application.

The application is written in C# and the complete source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/PenguinPlanner). You should be able to build the application after downloading the referenced nuget packages. However, you'd need to recreate the database and change the connection string to be able to run it.
