## Who am I?

Hi there, you can call me Sam. I'm a 1m96 tall guy and that will probably be the answer to your first question when you see me.

## What do I do?

I'm finishing my IT studies at [Odisee UC (used to be called HUB-EHSAL)](http://www.odisee.be/Odisee/Sections/Odisee-About-us.html) as an intern at [RealDolmen](http://realdolmen.be/en). My internship is about cross platform mobile app development with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).

Meanwhile, I'm also part-time ASP.NET (C#) developer at [Comm-IT](http://comm-it.be/) and IT manager and member of the board at [our UC's student council](http://asr.ac).

When I'm not reading up on the newest programming languages, development frameworks etc. I'm probably busy playing with them. My interests lie in (RESTful) APIs and cross platform apps.

My dream job would be titled *Continuous Integration Consultant*. I looooove CI tools. Continuous integration and continuous testing are the best and easiest ways to improve the quality of software. As a software developer, it's an awesome experience to automagically receive feedback about your code in just a few minutes after pushing fresh code.

## How can you contact me?

You should send me an email at [s@muel.be](mailto:s@muel.be) or a tweet at [@SamuelDebruyn](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=SamuelDebruyn).

## What do I do for fun?

While my blog is all about technology, my tweets sometimes make it look like I also spend time not sitting behind a computer. I once was a guitarist in a local indie rock band, but nowadays I just like to go to concerts, travel and spend time with my girlfriend and my friends.

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
