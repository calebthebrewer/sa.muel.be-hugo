## Who am I?

Hi there, you can call me Sam. I am an IT student by day and software development tinkerer by night. I'll soon graduate so internships and job offers are welcome. My resume is available on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/samueldebruyn).

## What do I do?

When I'm not reading up on the newest programming languages, development frameworks etc. I'm probably busy playing with them. My interests lie in (RESTful) APIs and cross platform apps. I especially like building complete SaaS solutions.

## How can you contact me?

You should send me an email at [s@muel.be](mailto:s@muel.be) or a tweet at [@SamuelDebruyn](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=SamuelDebruyn).

## How about a nice quote?

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
