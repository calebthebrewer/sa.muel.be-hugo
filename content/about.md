## Who am I?

Hi there, you can call me Sam. I'm a C# .NET developer by day and software development tinkerer by night.

## What do I do?

I'm finishing my IT studies at [Odisee](http://www.odisee.be/Odisee/Sections/Odisee-About-us.html) as an intern at [RealDolmen](http://realdolmen.be/en). My internship is about cross platform mobile app development with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).

When I'm not reading up on the newest programming languages, development frameworks etc. I'm probably busy playing with them. My interests lie in (RESTful) APIs and cross platform apps. I especially like building complete SaaS solutions.

## How can you contact me?

You should send me an email at [s@muel.be](mailto:s@muel.be) or a tweet at [@SamuelDebruyn](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=SamuelDebruyn).

## How about a nice quote?

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
